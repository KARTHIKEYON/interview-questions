In a toy shop there are a number of toys presented with several various â€“ priced toys in a specific order. You have a limited budget and would like to select the greatest number of consecutive toys that fit within the budget. Given prices of the toys and your budget, what is the maximum number of toys that can be purchased for your child?

Example:

prices=[1,4,5,3,2,1,6]

money=6

All sub arrays that sum to less than or equal to 6 .

length 1:  [1] [4] [5] [3] [2] [1] [6]

length 2:  [1,4] [3,2] [2,1] 

length 3: [3,2,1]

The longest of these or the maximum number of toys that can be purchased is 3.


program
/*
public class MaxToys {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Example input
        int[] prices = {1, 4, 5, 3, 2, 1, 6};
        int budget = 6;

        // Variables to keep track of the start of the window, current sum, and max length
        int start = 0;
        int currentSum = 0;
        int maxLength = 0;

        // Iterate through the array with the end of the window
        for (int end = 0; end < prices.length; end++) {
            // Add the current price to the sum
            currentSum += prices[end];
            
            // Shrink the window from the start if the current sum exceeds the budget
            while (currentSum > budget) {
                currentSum -= prices[start];
                start++;
            }
            
            // Update the maximum length of toys that can be bought within the budget
            int currentLength = end - start + 1;
            if (currentLength > maxLength) {
                maxLength = currentLength;
            }
        }

        // Print the result
        System.out.println("Maximum number of toys that can be bought: " + maxLength);
    }
}
*/
output:
Maximum number of toys that can be bought: 3
